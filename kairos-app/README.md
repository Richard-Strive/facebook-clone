# HEEEELLO AND WELCOME TO MY SOLO COPSTONE PROJECT 🚀

The solo capstone was the best challenge ever at Strive School.🤩

Developing this project was an opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills: my main goal.

Probably the approach that I have in my codebase to solve some issues is not the best,i was tailoring every line of code from an initial thought, but as I said above... Problem-solving was my goal.

# Messages

MAKE SURE TO CLICK ON THE PROFILE BUTTON BEFORE CLICKING THE MESSAGING ICON AND USE IT

MAKE SURE YOU SEND A FRIEND REQUEST AND LOG AGAIN AND HOPE THAT THE OTHER USER ACCEPT'S IT SO YOU CAN SELECT HIM FROM THE FRIEND LIST AND CHAT WITH HIM

AT THE MOMENT YOU CAN SEE THE MESSAGE THAT YOU'VE SENT ONLY WHEN THE FRIEND REPLY 😅

# FACE-AUTH

MAKE SURE YOU ENABLE FACE-AUTH IN THE PROFILE PAGE

LOG AGAIN AND TEST IT 😉

## LAST BUT NOT LEAST,  DON'T RELOAD THE PAGE! IF YOU DO?! A KRAKEN WILL SWALLOW YOUR COMPUTER AND YOU WILL BE PROJECTED TO ANOTHER PARALLEL DIMENSION.


## VERY HAPPY ABOUT WHAT I HAVE ACHIEVED SO FAR. THANK YOU STRIVE SCHOOL FOR ALL THIS 🤩

Just remembering that I've started from zero at my day one at Strive School and day by day I've learnt HTML, CSS, JS and much more...

WHAT A JOURNEY 🥵

By the way visitor, 
Thank you for being here.
Peace ✌️
