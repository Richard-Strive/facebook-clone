# HEEEELLO AND WELCOME TO MY SOLO COPSTONE PROJECT üöÄ

The solo capstone was the best challenge ever at Strive School.ü§©

Developing this project was an opportunity to enhance my problem-solving skills: my main goal.

Probably the approach that I have in my codebase to solve some issues is not the best,i was tailoring every line of code from an initial thought, but as I said above... Problem-solving was my goal.
